* Differential per-layer learning rates
* Maybe lora training on a Qwen3 model?
* Try using "enhanced head" with mean pooling
* Make using mean pooling / CLS / CLS+Mean pooling configurable
* Use Muon optimizer https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon
* Hyperparameter sweep

## Data Enhancements
* Split data samples into subsets and test (i.e. evaluate)
* Create synthetic data
* Find additional data sources
* Modify existing data
    - Make it more obvious
    - Make it less obvious
    - Mix two different ones
    - Try interpolation between two different ones (e.g. positive and negative) on the label side and split half-half for the sample??
